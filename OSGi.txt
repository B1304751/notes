-OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) is a Java Framework for developing and deploying modular
software program and libraries.
-OSGi has two partts. The first parts is a specifiaction for modular compoments called bundles,
which are commonly refered to as plug-ins. The specifiaction defines an infrastructure for bundle's
life cycle and determines how bundles will interact. The second part of OSGi is a virtual machine(JVM)
-level service registry that bundles can use to push, discover and bind to services-oriented architecture.
-OSGi, created for Java systems, provides a framework for modular systems. OSGi makes it possible to define
the dependencies of ech individual module with the others and enables users to control the lifecycle and 
dynamically change each component of system.On the deploymen stage, each OSGi bundle is a jar file. But the 
main different of bundle java files with regular ones can be counted as the OSGi specific manifest definition 
adn some OSGi specific classes.
-A bundle is a jar file with some special infomation in its manifest that identifies it, gives a version, and 
specifies dependencies.
-What's software modularity?
	An application consists of different parts, these are typically called software components or software modules.
 The components interact with each other via a Application Programing Interface (API). The API is defined as a set
 of classes and methods which can be uesed from other components. A component also has set of classes and methods which
 are considered as internal to the software component.
 component exits and works correctly.
	If a component uses an API from other component, it has a dependency to the other componet..ie.,it requires the other
